# Introduction
Summer is coming so I’ve decided to write a blog entry describing some resolutions for the next academic year. I want to improve some things in my life before the start of school.

#	Academic life
I promise I am going to be more dedicated in my life and my studies, but I will try to do it in a way that I can be more efficient in my studies. When someone asks me for help, I will try to help them. As soon as I finish my homework, I will try to make sure that I have done it well, and that I understand what I did. To do so, I know that I must be more focused in classes.
#	Personal attitude
This paragraph is focused on my personal life and my own work. I think that I’m good at planning and developing projects. However, my main problem is that I usually have too many projects opened at the same time and I have no time to work on them. Therefore, my resolution for the next academic year is that I am going to work on them in a more efficient without wasting time. So, I will choose my projects more carefully taking into account what  I can learn from them and not spending time on useless projects. Last but not least, I will try to sleep more and reduce the time spent in front of the computer.
#	Conclusion
I wish these resolutions help me to improve my life and my studies and to be a better person! .*Cya!*
